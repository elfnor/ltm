It's been a while since I've regularly updated this blog (blame the day job and life). Here's some updates and links on stuff related to addons I've made for Blender or scripted nodes for Sverchok.

## Generative Art in Sverchok for Blender

The node I wrote to do 3D L-systems in Blender via the [Sverchok add-on](http://nikitron.cc.ua/sverch/html/main.html) is now a node in the main release of Sverchok.  It has been kept updated  by others on the Sverchok team and works with the latest Blender. It's now in Sverchok under `Nodes > Generator > Generative Art` See the [offical docs](https://sverchok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nodes/generators_extended/generative_art.html)

My work was inspired by [Structure Synth](http://structuresynth.sourceforge.net/). Kronpano has  made  [BrowserSynth](https://github.com/kronpano/BrowserSynth) an online implementation of Structure Synth. It uses the original eisenscript notation.

[Humphrey Hippo](https://humphreyhippo.wordpress.com/) had a number of blog posts on Generative Art in Sverchok. 

See his [structure-synth tag](https://humphreyhippo.wordpress.com/category/structure-synth/) for a full list but particularly:

* [Preparing Eisenscript for the XML Translator](https://humphreyhippo.wordpress.com/2017/12/20/preparing-eisenscript-for-the-xml-translator/)

If you want to learn Sverchok [codeplastic's ebook](http://www.codeplastic.com/learning-sverchok-ebook/) looks like a great place to start.
